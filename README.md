# Pok√©dex

Hello!üëã

This project is a **Pok√©dex** created using *JavaScript, HTML and CSS*.  
It's based on this video: [Youtube Tutorial - Pokedex](https://youtu.be/SjtdH3dWLa8?si=1vwKMiZyONXD019L)  
  
  I implemented new ***features*** such as:
 - Pok√©mon Types
 - Status section with status bars
 - Pok√©mon sounds
 - Improved display and search

## API

I used [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch the data:
 - Name
 - Number
 - Image
 - Sound
 - Type(s)
 - Stats

## Search

It's possible to search the Pok√©mon by **Name** or **ID**.  
  
I limited the search to Pok√©mon up to the ***7th Generation*** (because of some errors fetching data in next generations).  
  
Still working in some searches and features... ‚ü≥

## Image and Sound

It displays a [.gif](https://www.howtogeek.com/441185/what-is-a-gif-and-how-do-you-use-them/) of the Pok√©mon and the respective [.ogg](https://www.movavi.com/pt/learning-portal/ogg-file.html) sound.

## Type and Stats bars

The type section shows one or two types of the chosen Pok√©mon that vary in color based on the type.  
  
The bars range from 0 to 255, and are proportional to the value.
